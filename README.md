## TODO:

- DONE - Setup testing environment
- DONE - Create test for closure convert
- Create test for parser/lexer
- Make a way of stopping a traversal short
  - This way the makeEnvRefCalls can use the generic traversal methods
    rather than having to rewrite it essentially.
- Generate some IR for the new closures
